It combines the simplicity and flexibility of Vue.js with convenient features for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side routing, making it ideal for both small and large projects. With Nuxt.js, you can develop web applications quickly and efficiently thanks to its convention-over-configuration approach. This allows you to spend less time setting up the project structure and focus more on writing code."
